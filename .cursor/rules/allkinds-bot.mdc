# Project Overview
## Project Name: Allkinds Bot
## Type: Telegram Bot System
## Purpose: Help people connect with like-minded individuals based on shared values, interests, and worldview.

# How It Works
## Group Creation
A group is created by an administrator (the "creator") within the main Allkinds Bot.

## Inviting Users
The creator invites others to join the group via a deep link or a unique 5-character invite code.

## Question Exchange & Matching

Group members ask yes/no-based questions or statements.

Answer options include: Strong No, No, Skip, Yes, Strong Yes.

Users answer their own and othersâ€™ questions.

Based on answer similarity, users receive recommendations of others who match them most closely.

## One-on-One Communication

When a match is found, both users are redirected to a secondary bot: Allkinds Chat Bot.

This bot facilitates deeper conversations and helps users decide whether to continue communication.

# AI-Powered Features
The system uses OpenAI models for:

Duplicate Question Detection: Prevents spam and repeat questions.

Content Moderation: Filters out inappropriate content (e.g., topics involving drugs, violence, hate speech, etc.).

Smart Question Routing: Prioritizes and suggests questions that are more relevant to each user.

Conversation Kickstarters: Surfaces deeper insights from shared answers to help users get to know each other on a meaningful level.
